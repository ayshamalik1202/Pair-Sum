# Pair-Sum
This is a simple C++ program that finds all pairs of numbers in a given array, finds the pair whose elementsâ€™ sum is equal to a target value and the indexes of these elements in the array.
## How it works:
1. Takes input for number of terms.
2. Takes input for array elements.
3. Takes a target sum.
4. Shows all pairs.
5. Highlights the pairs that match the target.
6. Show the indexes of the elements of the pair.
## How to run:
1. Open Code::Blocks.
2. Load your Pair_Sum.cpp file.
3. Click Build and Run.
4. Input values in the console.
## Sample Output:
Number of terms: 5  
Given array is: 1 3 2 4 5  
The target value is: 6  
Pair is: (1,3)  
Pair is: (1,2) 
...  
The pair which sum is equal to 6 is (2,4)  
The indexes of numbers of the pair are 2 and 3
